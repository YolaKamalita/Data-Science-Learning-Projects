## Machine Learning
- Crimes Rate Prediction: Exploring various regression methods and feature selection techniques to model crimes rate prediction given 100 available features. The main interest is to find a solution that resulted in the highest accuracy for the prediction, and the stories behind it.
  - [Linear Regression with Regularization: Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net](https://github.com/YolaKamalita/Data-Science-Learning-Projects/blob/main/crimes_prediction/02_Linear_Regression_Regularization.ipynb)
- Drug Reviews: Exploring techniques to preprocess texts and convert them into vectors, then building classification model to predict the patient sentiment whether positive or negative.
  - [Text Analytics with NLTK and SVM](https://github.com/YolaKamalita/Data-Science-Learning-Projects/blob/main/drug_reviews/01_text_analytics_ntlk_svm.ipynb)
