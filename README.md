## Machine Learning
- Crimes Rate Prediction: Investigating different regression methods and feature selection techniques to model crime rates using 100 available features. The primary goal is to identify the approach that yields the highest prediction accuracy, while uncovering the underlying factors driving the results.
  - [Linear Regression with Regularization: Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net](https://github.com/YolaKamalita/Data-Science-Learning-Projects/blob/main/crimes_prediction/02_Linear_Regression_Regularization.ipynb)
- Drug Reviews: Exploring text preprocessing techniques to convert textual data into vectors, followed by building a classification model to predict patient sentiment as either positive or negative.
  - [Text Analytics with NLTK and SVM](https://github.com/YolaKamalita/Data-Science-Learning-Projects/blob/main/drug_reviews/01_text_analytics_ntlk_svm.ipynb)
